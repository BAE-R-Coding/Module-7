# Module 7: Joins, Strings, Factors, Dates, and Times in R

**Part 1: Work through R4DS Chapters** 
- [R4DS Chapter 13: Relational data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html)
- [R4DS Chapter 14.1 and 14.2: Strings Introduction and Strings Basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)
- [R4DS Chapter 15: Factors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html)
- [R4DS Chapter 16: Dates and times](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html)

**Part 2: Watch and work alongside the video lectures**
- [Working with factors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxSZs1D9x4k&feature=youtu.be)
- [Using the lubridate cheat sheet and parsing dates in R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIkPsCIT4QY&feature=youtu.be)

**Part 3: Complete the homework**

The homework is described in the `homework-colorado-river.html` file (also available as a PDF) in this repository. I recommend working from the html file as opposed to the PDF as the formatting is a bit nicer. For this module, **do not** push your code to your GitHub repository. You will submit your .R script directly through the Moodle assignment.
